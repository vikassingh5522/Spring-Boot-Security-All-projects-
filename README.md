# Spring Boot Security ‚Äî All Projects

A collection of hands-on demo projects exploring different security implementations using **Spring Boot**. This repo showcases how to secure web apps & APIs using approaches like JWT, REST authentication, SOAP, and more.

## üß∞ What‚Äôs Inside

The repository includes multiple example/demo projects, such as:

| Project                                        | Purpose / Features                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `spring-boot-security-jwt-authentication-main` | Demonstrates JWT-based authentication in Spring Boot, securing REST endpoints.  |
| `SecurityRestApiDemo2`                         | REST API with security filters and role-based access control.                   |
| `SecurityDemo1`                                | Basic Spring Security configuration demo (login, logout, simple auth).          |
| `SecurityBankingApiDemo3`                      | Banking API with security: authenticated operations, restricted resources.      |
| `soap-producing-web-service`                   | SOAP-based service with security considerations.                                |
| `soap-crud-app`                                | SOAP CRUD application showing how security can be integrated in SOAP endpoints. |

## üîç Purpose & Audience

This collection is useful for:

* Developers learning about Spring Security (REST & SOAP)
* Understanding how different authentication mechanisms (JWT, role-based auth) are implemented
* Seeing sample projects for studying or as starting templates

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Key Practices

* Spring Boot framework
* Spring Security
* JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless auth
* Role-based authorization
* REST API security filters
* Integration of security in SOAP web services

---

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Pick one of the project folders.
3. Review its `README` (if present) or source code to see how security is configured.
4. Run the project (e.g. via `mvn spring-boot:run` or import into IDE).
5. Try endpoints, inspect how JWT tokens / authentication works.

---

## üìà Possible Improvements

* Add clearer individual READMEs for each project showing endpoints, request/response samples.
* Demo client apps or Postman collections to test secured endpoints.
* Add tests to check security behavior (e.g. unauthorized access, role-based access).
* Improve documentation of differences between the projects.
